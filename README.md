# TODO App Challange By Vitc Codechef Club

This is a simple todo list web-app exploring the basics of react along with expressJS backend.

The technologies used in this project are:

- ReactTsx 
- CSS
- ExpressJS

## Get Started

Due to limitations on github hosting and lack of SSL certificates we will have to run this app on a local express server.
Here is how you can set it up

- Install `Node JS`:
  (skip this step if you already have it installed)
  <br>
  [Install Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
  <br> 
- Download the server zip file:
  <br>
  [servers.zip](https://www.mediafire.com/file/ugubymfcpekbgei/servers.zip/file)
  <br>
- Extract the zip file on your computer at a known file path and copy that file path
- Open command prompt or terminal and run the following commands:
```shell
  cd <Extracted File Path>
  node appserver.js
```
(note you may need to give special permissions so run your command prompt in admin mode and terminal in sudo mode and give max permissions)

- After the server is running open the website from the link:
