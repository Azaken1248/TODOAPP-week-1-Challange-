# TODO App Challange By Vitc Codechef Club

This is a simple todo list web-app exploring the basics of react along with expressJS backend.

The technologies used in this project are:

- ReactTsx 
- CSS
- ExpressJS

## Get Started

Due to limitations on github hosting and lack of SSL certificates we will have to run this app on a local express server.
Here is how you can set it up

- Install `Node JS`:
  (skip this step if you already have it installed)
  <br>
  [Install Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
  <br> 
- Clone or download this repository:
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/Azaken1248/TODOAPP-week-1-Challange-.git
  ```
  Or
  <br>
  [TODOApp.zip](https://github.com/Azaken1248/TODOAPP-week-1-Challange-/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

  <br>

- Extract the zip file on your computer at a known file path and copy that file path
- Open command prompt or terminal and run the following commands:
  ```sh
    cd <Extracted Path>/TODOAPP-week-1-Challange-
    cd src/servers
    npm i express
    node appserver.js
  ```
(note you may need to give special permissions so run your command prompt in admin mode and terminal in sudo mode and give max permissions)

- After the server is running open the website from the link:
  <br>
  [TODO APP](https://azaken1248.github.io/TODOAPP-week-1-Challange-/)
  <br>
- You can enter two test usernames with pre-filled data
  <br>
   ```Azaken```
  <br>
   ```rohit```

 Note: To run the server on your phone use an android phone with the termux app and execute the server from there
